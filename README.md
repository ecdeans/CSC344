// Assignment 1: Error Detection

Wrote the computeCheckSum() and verifyCheckSum() methods.

Instructions TLDR:
Implement error detection using a single parity bit for every 7 bits. Modify the most-significant bit
to have the parity we choose. This turns the ASCII character into a Unicode character. If there is a one-bit 
error (in other words, flip any single bit), then the parity will not match and we can know that the character 
that we received is incorrect.
